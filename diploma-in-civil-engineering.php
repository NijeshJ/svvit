        <h1>Diploma in Civil Engineering</h1>

        <p>Civil Engineering is a versatile and fundamental branch among the other engineering branches. This branch has a lot of diversity right from geotechnical sciences to structural Engineering, environmental to hydraulics, transportation to hydrology. It offers a wide promising career opportunities and professional advancement.</p>



<p>The course aims at producing highly qualified, efficient junior engineers / technicians capable of meeting the requirements of the basic level of the Civil Engineering field. During the course of study, the student is exposed to various subjects of Civil Engineering such as Planning, Drafting (both manual and computer aided), Surveying, Estimation & Costing, Construction Technology, Basics of Highway, Railway, Bridge, Airport, Tunnel and Harbour Engineering. The course also offers adequate exposure to Reinforced Concrete Structures, Quality Control, Material Testing, Construction Management & Entrepreneurship, Professional Practice and Office Procedures. Students also get a feel of Extensive Survey, Building Drawing, Irrigation & Bridge Drawing and Structural Engineering Drawing. Students are also exposed to software like AUTOCAD & STAAD.</p>



<p>Career opportunities exist in the public and private sectors in the areas of design, construction and maintenance, infrastructure development in both India and abroad. Many opportunities exist in developing countries in Middle East, Africa and Asia where infrastructure development is picking up and Indian engineers are in great demand. At present good placement opportunities are available for diploma holders in the field of Civil Engineering, both in Government & Private Sectors. They can be absorbed as site engineers involved in supervision, draftsman (with computer knowledge), surveyors, and personnel in-charge of quality control, estimation work and office procedures. They can establish their own consultancy in the Civil Engineering and Construction fields or become Licensed Class I Contractors.</p>



<p>The Department of Civil Engineering has qualified and dedicated faculty. The Surveying Practice, Basic Material Testing, Geology, Hydraulics, Geotechnical and Computer Aided Design (CAD) laboratories have modern equipments. The Department organizes technical paper presentation and encourages students to present technical papers at Conferences and Journals. Students are given an opportunity to travel out of district as well for surveying and are motivated to learn on real time experience basis.</p>
