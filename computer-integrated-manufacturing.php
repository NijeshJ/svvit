        <h1>M.Tech. in Computer Integrated Manufacturing</h1>

    

<p>

The program aims to integrate total manufacturing enterprise by using integrated systems and data communication. It encompasses CAD/CAM, Flexible Manufacturing (FMS), Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) and scheduling. CIM with an integration of both hardware and software realizes real-time process simulation and Computer Numerically Controlled manufacturing.</p>



<p>The program mainly focuses on Optimization of manufacturing processes using System Simulation, FEA, Automation through Hydraulic and Pneumatic Control Systems and Robotics, Advanced Sensors such as MEMS used for Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Optimization Techniques, etc. Students have access to Industry â€“ RVCE collaborative lab (Centre of Excellence for Industrial Automation) set up with Bosch Rexroth, on Hydraulic and Pnuematic Control Systems in the department. Students can work in the areas of design of nanosensors and MEMS in association with the on-going research projects of the faculty members sponsored by agencies such as DRDO laboratories, ISRO, AICTE, DST and other agencies.</p>
