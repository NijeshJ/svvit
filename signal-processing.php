        <h1>M.Tech in Signal Processing</h1>

    

<p>

The M.Tech in Signal Processing is aimed at providing a deep understanding of the mathematical application, theoretical and practical aspects of signal processing area. The curriculum comprises of subjects related to the signal processing area under the broad categories of mathematics for signal processing, fundamental and advanced topics in signal processing, and applications of signal processing in communication, image and video processing, computer vision, biomedical signal processing, speech and audio processing areas.</p>



<p>The students will be studying the theory and laboratory courses in the above mentioned categories during their first and second semesters. This will be followed by a research based project work spread across third and fourth semesters and is aimed at developing new signal processing methods and systems useful for communication, image, video, biomedical, speech and audio processing. Thus, the students get a deeper understanding in the signal processing area and also a training to carryout research work.</p>
