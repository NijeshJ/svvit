        <h1>INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP</h1>

    <p>College and industry partnerships are collaborations between the college and an individual business, group of firms, industry association, or industry sector. They combine public and private resources including human resource, facilities, equipment, and expertise to create alternative college education programs that are tightly linked to regional industry development. By partnering with private industry, these programs ensure that academic credentials are directly linked to current job requirements and that program expansion is based on future job openings.</p>
